# CHALLENGE NOTES

## React sandbox repo

Add the capability for a user to sign in and sign out with google to your react sandbox repo

### Extension

- See what information is returned in the user object from firebase after login

- Add private routing to the application. It should have at least one authenticated/private route (it's perfectly fine if this is just a page saying "Private route"). 
Once complete a user should land on a page and be unable to access your private route (either by url or link). Once logged in they should then be able to route to the private route page. If they then log out they should be navigated away from the private route.
